== DESIGN: libdbquery ==
========================
- DBConnection
	- One instance per executable
	- Wraps around the connection process
	- Spawns objects that share the connection
		- DBResult (actual objects)

- DBResult
	- One single row in a single table
	- Data can be stored in DB using a DB transaction


- DBTransaction
	- Constructed with the connection object
	- Should be used to construct data specific objects
	- Uses DB Transactions

==============
== BUILDING ==
==============
1) Replace "database.sql" with your schema design

2) Run buildDBCPP.py to convert the schema into a C++ compliant structure and code

3) build libdbquery
	cd libdbquery
	make
	make install
	cd ../

	#NOTE: If you are running a test environment run to make the dynamic library linking point to this directory
		sudo ./create_ldconfig_link.sh

4) Build the schema
	make
	make install

5) Build your own application
	#NOTES:
		- Link to libdbquery
		- Link to lib<schema_name> - This is your custom library
