+ Split out file reader into own repo
+ Move base classes into own repo (build into debian)
	+ Move db* files into their own library
	+ Make library for base classes of demodb
+ Split out the file reader into its own repo. This allows code reuse for building web pages automatically 
+ Use a cstruct to build the menu (universal file for cms)
+ Web pagess should be built with a scc script from style templates specifications (in db)
+ Make caching work on db for quick behaviour 
+ Make query objects accessible from schema class and parent classes
+ schema to implement all the class processing for parent and children (avoids looped dependencies)
+ Sub table primary key
+ Sub table secondary key (indexes!)
+ Sub table foreign key
+ Vector of shared pointers of row data? (Do these get cleared up? )- owned by parent table?
+ Store child data as an array of stored pointers
+ Template functions to get specifix values from an array (is this possible? )
+ Implement the update delete insert queries
+ Include a locking mechanism in database

DONE
+ Add regex to parse DB inputs to make sure they are safe
+ Create type specific regex templates
+ For string inputs allow free-text regex from the child library
